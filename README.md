## Testing the Application

### Tests for Cloudflare Worker
A test suite has been added for the Cloudflare Worker fetch handler, located in the `tests` directory. This suite ensures that the handler responds correctly.

### Running Tests
To run the tests, use the command:
```bash
npm test
```

### Managing Dependencies for GitHub Actions Workflow
To ensure consistent installations of dependencies within the GitHub Actions workflow, you should manage your dependencies by regularly running either `npm install` or `yarn`. It is crucial to keep a lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) in the repository. This lock file helps to maintain consistent environments across different deployments, facilitating a smoother CI/CD process and avoiding potential issues with mismatched dependency versions.

### Maintaining Synchronization
It is essential to keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in sync during development. Whenever you modify dependencies, ensure that both files reflect the same versions to avoid discrepancies that could lead to inconsistencies in builds or runtime environments.

### Dependency Management
A `package-lock.json` file has been generated to lock the dependencies for this project. This ensures consistent installations across different environments.

### Expected Changes
- Updated to confirm local tests were successful.
